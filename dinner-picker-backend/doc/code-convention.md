# Code convention

In order to create a clean/maintainable/extensible code, we should have code conventions. We will minimize this for a quick development.

1. When you add codes, write your name to indicate your part. It will help people to figure out who wrote the codes. It should start with //[name]-S and be done with //[name]-E
2. In the comment, write all the variables in the square bracket. // [variableName]
3. We will follow the official code convention of the language we will use. 
4. Write wrong comments for each file & functions to explain what it is. 
5. Always indicate the type of the variables with """@params [type] [variableName]"""
