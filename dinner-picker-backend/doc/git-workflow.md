# git workflow

1. master branch should always work. Merging to master branch will only be done under everyone's agreement. 
2. Use a develop branch as a place to merge different local branches. 
3. When you work with your part, create your own branch with this form. [describe briefly what you do (ex) feature]/[details]/[yourName] 
4. Before you merge to a develop branch, you should always show your commit to other person for a code review. Person who reviews the code can merge it to develop branch
