# Rule

We will define some rules to keep here. Please don't feel hesitate to add new rules. Before you write new rules here, please slack it in proposal channel.

1. We won't use TDD development for a quick development. We will still have as many as unit tests for robust codes.
2. When you create a doc, you should be writing in doc file. It should be done with -[yourName]
3. Your functions or files should not be too long. Always break down stuff. 
4. Everyone should dedicate to the project. At least 8 hours a week of participation is a must. 
5. Don't write too many COMMENTS. Good codes will be self-explanatory. Use comments only for explaining functions/files or too complicated logics
